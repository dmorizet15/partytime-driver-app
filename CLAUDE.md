## Current Build State (as of April 27, 2026)

### v1.1 COMPLETE ✅ — April 27, 2026
All phases shipped to production.

- Phase 0: Dashboard repo scaffolded and deployed
- Phase 0.5: PTR Design System v1.0 defined in Notion
- Phase 1 — Supabase Auth (both apps, production) ✅
  - Migrations 001–005 applied to partytime-east
  - Driver app + dashboard auth live in production
  - Session persistence, refresh, and sign out all working
  - Critical fix: INITIAL_SESSION deadlock in supabase-js v2 — `getUserRole()` uses direct fetch() with access_token to bypass internal getSession() call
- Phase 2 — Cross-Device OTW State Sync ✅
  - Migration 006: `stops` table gets `otw_status`, `otw_timestamp`, `otw_set_by`
  - `StopStateService.ts` — writes localStorage first (instant UI), then Supabase async; offline queue flushed on reconnect
  - `AppStateContext.loadDay` merges Supabase OTW > localStorage > TapGoods default
  - OTW state is now cross-device; localStorage remains fallback if Supabase unreachable
- Phase 3 — Send ETA/OTW wired to `/api/send-eta` ✅
  - `routeId` added to `SendEtaParams`
  - OTW failures show inline red banner (replaced `alert()`)
- Phase 4 — POD photo UI polish ✅
  - Take Photo/Retry uses PTR primary blue (#0000FF)
  - Uploaded/failed states use styled PTR cards
  - Image preview: border-2, shadow, overflow-hidden
- ETA/SMS Phase 1 live in production (April 21, 2026)
- TapGoods Phase 1 integration live in production (April 20, 2026)

### NEXT — Dashboard Build
Driver app v1.1 is complete. Next session begins the partytime-dashboard feature build.
See `~/Projects/partytime-dashboard` and Notion for the dashboard build plan.

## Key TapGoods API Learnings (do not re-discover)
- Root GraphQL type is `ExternalQuery` (not `Query`)
- `beingPickedUp` does NOT exist on `getRentals`
- `isDraft` is a valid query arg but NOT a selectable field
- `truckNeeded: true` is a superset of `beingDelivered: true` — use both with pagination
- Results paginate at 200/page — service stops may be on page 2+
- View Order URL: `https://business.tapgoods.com/orders/rentals/{token}/pickList`
- PhoneNumber type uses field `cell` (not `number`)
- Stop ordering: `position: 0` is valid first stop (not "unset") — only `null` is unset

---

## Active Blockers
- Easy RFID Pro does not launch on real Android device (out of v1.1 scope)
- CoPilot destination import needs final validation on real device

## Out of v1.1 Scope
- RFID launch feature (dropped)
- Apple Sign In (deferred)
- Google OAuth for driver app (deferred — email/password only on PWA)
- Offline queue service worker (Phase 2+)
- DOT pre-trip inspection (Phase 2+)

---

## Pre-Push Verification (mandatory)

`npx next lint` is **not sufficient**. ESLint does not run TypeScript's type checker — it can pass on code that fails `next build`. Vercel's build pipeline runs the full type check after compile, so a green lint locally and a red Vercel deployment is a real failure mode.

**Before every push to `main`:**
1. `npx next build` — must succeed end-to-end (compile + type check + page generation)
2. Only then `git push`

**Incident — May 6, 2026:** Cash-collection feature (commit `449693e`) passed `npx next lint` with zero errors but failed Vercel's `next build` on a `WorkflowEventType` mismatch (`'CASH_COLLECTED'` not in the union). Fix-forward in `4dda705`. Lesson: lint is a subset of build; never substitute one for the other.
