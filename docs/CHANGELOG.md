## 2026-05-08 — Phase 2B stop-level weather + day-filter bug fix

**Scope:** Two pieces of work, one driver-facing, one bug discovered during smoke test.

### Phase 2B — Stop-level weather badges on Stop Detail
- **`src/components/weather/StopWeatherModule.tsx`** (new) — adaptive dark card sized for Stop Detail. Wind status always visible (collapsed or expanded), snow client-discussion callout always visible if snow forecasted, lightning STOP override replaces wind row with prominent banner. Auto-expands on any caution+ condition; manual collapse only when fully clear.
- **`src/hooks/useStopWeather.ts`** (new) — thin client wrapper around `/api/weather?lat=&lng=`. Server already caches by 4-decimal coords for 15 min, so revisiting the same stop within that window costs nothing. Cancellation handles fast inter-stop swipes.
- **`src/screens/StopDetailScreen.tsx`** — module renders above Manifest section, gated on `HAS_STOP_LEVEL_BADGES === true` AND stop has lat/lng AND `stop_type !== 'warehouse'`. Layout placement decision: above-manifest (per spec discussion). Warehouse stops skipped (depot context, weather signal less relevant).
- **`src/lib/weather/thresholds.ts`** — flipped `HAS_STOP_LEVEL_BADGES` from `false` to `true`. The `HAS_TENT_SIZE_DATA` and `HAS_ANCHORING_GUIDANCE` stub flags stay `false` (separate work).
- **Reuse over rebuild:** No new threshold logic. The locked evaluators (`evaluateWindWindow`, `evaluateRainWindow`, `evaluateSnowWindow`, `evaluateLightning`) and `STATUS_COLORS` from Phase 2A are imported as-is. Visual language matches Phase 2A's standalone weather screen so drivers recognize the same signals across surfaces.

### Bug fix — `/api/routes` was leaking ghost stops onto driver day view
- Discovered during Phase 2B smoke test: driver app showed 6 stops on today's Route 1 while the dashboard correctly showed 3.
- **Root cause:** the endpoint filtered `dispatch_stops` only by `route_id IN today's_route_ids` — no actionability signal. Stale assignments (stops dragged onto a route weeks ago and never optimized or unassigned) leaked through.
- **First attempt:** `.eq('scheduled_date', date)` — too tight. Pickup stubs anchor `scheduled_date` to a past Monday by design (auto-stub anchor in tapgoodsSync), so legit stubs got hidden.
- **Final fix:** `.not('calculated_eta', 'is', null)`. The route time calculator (NOT the Optimize button) sets `calculated_eta` automatically when stops are added to a route with a start time and drive times. Populated ETA = "this stop has been routed for today and is actionable." Null ETA = orphan assignment. Verified against actual production data (4 legit stops with ETAs vs 3 ghosts without).
- **Note:** This is a workaround. The principled fix lives in the dashboard — when a stop is assigned to a route, also update `scheduled_date` to match the route's `route_date`. Tracked as a follow-up in `tasks/todo.md`.

### Drive-by: trimmed leaked CLI text from `src/types/supabase.ts`
- Two trailing lines of Supabase CLI version-notice text (committed by accident on 2026-05-07's regen) were causing the lint parse step of `npx next build` to fail. Trimmed; build clean again. Future regens should suppress stderr (`supabase gen types typescript --linked 2>/dev/null > path`).

### Files changed
- `src/components/weather/StopWeatherModule.tsx` (new)
- `src/hooks/useStopWeather.ts` (new)
- `src/screens/StopDetailScreen.tsx` (module integration)
- `src/lib/weather/thresholds.ts` (flag flip)
- `src/app/api/routes/route.ts` (calculated_eta filter)
- `src/types/supabase.ts` (CLI text cleanup)

### Migrations applied
- None in this repo. The dashboard's Migration 034 (geocoding state columns + trigger) is what unblocked Phase 2B.

### Smoke tests
- Phase 2B module renders above manifest on a real production stop with valid coords. Hudson Valley coordinates confirmed (e.g. Bronxville pickup at 41.0085, -73.8344).
- Day-filter fix: today's Route 1 now shows exactly 3 stops, matching dashboard. Route 2 shows the second-truck Sarah Lawrence pickup. No ghost stops from prior weeks.

### Commits
- `6804347` — feat(weather): Phase 2B stop-level weather badges on Stop Detail (Vercel deploy `eyvy5gtap`, Ready 37s)
- `519282c` — fix(api/routes): filter dispatch_stops by scheduled_date so stale stops drop out (Vercel deploy `1ibeg1z16`, Ready 38s)
- `470ec19` — fix(api/routes): use calculated_eta as actionability signal, not scheduled_date (Vercel deploy `jjyb2qtzy`, Ready 34s)

### Open follow-ups (tracked in `tasks/todo.md`)
- Dashboard data hygiene: assigning a stop to a route should sync `scheduled_date` to the route's `route_date`. Once that ships, this repo's `calculated_eta IS NOT NULL` filter can revert to the simpler `scheduled_date = date`.
