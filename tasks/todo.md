# Open Tasks — partytime-driver-app

## June 2, 2026 — Three driver-app fixes (direct to `main`, `e41c976`; `npx next build` green; Migration 021 applied + repaired)

- [ ] **Smoke test — Fix 1 (Home post-inspection flow):**
  1. Pre-inspection Home: the "REQUIRED FIRST / Pre-trip inspection" card is GONE; the only inspection trigger is the gold "Inspect & Start Route" bottom CTA. The stop list shows but is dimmed/non-tappable.
  2. Tap "Inspect & Start Route" → complete the inspection → its final CTA lands you on the **Route page** (`/route/[id]`), NOT Home.
  3. Return to Home: the stop list is STILL there (not cleared/hidden), now full-opacity and tappable; the bottom CTA reads **"Continue route"** and jumps to the Route page. (AVA brief / weather / Ask Ava stay hidden post-inspection — intentional, stop-list-only persistence.)
  4. Complete a stop → on BOTH Home and the Route list its numbered circle flips to an ink fill with a gold checkmark.
- [ ] **Smoke test — Fix 2 (zip-ties note):** open the morning checklist → the "Zip ties" always-carry item no longer shows the "Dylan interview May 24" sub-note.
- [ ] **Smoke test — Fix 3 (tent tools):** a route with a tent item → morning checklist "FOR TODAY'S ROUTE" includes **Hammer + Sledgehammer** (plus the existing Pry bar). A route with an inflatable → Hammer + Hand truck. A route with BOTH → Hammer (once), Sledgehammer, Hand truck, Pry bar.
- [ ] **Tent detection caveat (Fix 3):** the new rules use `category='TENTS'` exact match (same as the Pry bar rule), so a stop carrying only TENTS-category accessories (sidewalls/walls, no actual tent) will also pull Hammer + Sledgehammer. Matches the existing Pry bar behavior; revisit only if a walls-only stop wrongly triggers tent tools in practice.

## May 31, 2026 — AVA Phase 2 — Session 2: Haiku conversation sheet + SOP search (MERGED to `main`, merge `02abfc6`; branch deleted)

Two deliverables + two follow-up fixes, all merged to `main` and the branch deleted (local + remote). `npx next build` green throughout and on the merged `main`. Prod SOP sync ran (`{synced:10}`). Migration 020 (`sop_entries` RLS) applied to the linked DB. **Pending: production smoke test on the live `main` deploy.** Next AVA work → a new `feature/ava-phase2-sN` branch.

- [x] ~~**Merge to `main`**~~ — done 2026-05-31 (`--no-ff`, merge `02abfc6`); branch `feature/ava-phase2-session2` deleted local + remote.
- [ ] **Production smoke test — Fix 1 (morning brief copy + tent threshold):** brief reads numbers as words ("two stops", "three tents") and 10+ as digits; no em-dash run-ons (natural pauses when read aloud); says "tents" not "canopies". A day with 2–4 tents gets a plain stop/COD line (NO "big tent day"); the heavy framing only appears at 5+ tents.
- [ ] **Production smoke test — Fix 2 (warehouse_notes):** on a stop with `warehouse_notes` set in the dashboard → Stop Detail shows a blue "FROM WAREHOUSE" block below "Note from dispatch"; navigating/Send-ETA pops the pre-launch sheet with a "FROM WAREHOUSE" section after the dispatcher note. Morning brief "N of your stops have notes" counts dispatcher-OR-warehouse stops (a stop with both counts once); tapping it opens "Notes for your stops" showing both note types labeled. A day with ONLY warehouse notes still shows the AVA card + count.
- [ ] **Production smoke test — Deliverable 1 (Ask Ava):**
  1. Home (pre-trip not yet done) → gold (+) "Ask Ava about today" between the stop list and the Inspect CTA. Tap → dark conversation sheet opens (not the old toast).
  2. Type a question about today (e.g. "How many stops do I have?" / "Any wind on my tents?" / "Which stops are COD?") → "AVA is thinking…" waveform → a concise spoken-style answer. With VOICE on, the answer is read aloud (ElevenLabs); toggle TEXT → no audio, switching mid-playback stops it.
  3. **Grounding check:** answers should match the Home numbers (stop count, COD count) and name the wind-alerted stops correctly; AVA should decline (not invent) anything outside the seeded context.
  4. **Failure path:** tasks rely on `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (already set in Vercel) — if a call fails, the sheet shows "AVA is unavailable right now. Try again in a moment." (no crash).
  5. Verify a row lands in `ava_conversations` (`surface='driver_home'`, `driver_id` = the signed-in driver, `context_id` = today's route id, question+answer populated).
- [ ] **Production smoke test — Deliverable 2 (SOP search):**
  1. Training Hub → "Look up an SOP" section at the top. Zero query → all driver-visible SOPs listed, sop_number ascending (SOP-001, 003, 005, …). **Confirm Warehouse-only / Operations SOPs are excluded** and driver/field/all ones are present.
  2. Type a term (e.g. "tent", "load", "incident") → 300 ms debounce → matching SOPs (title + content match). Tap a card → full content expands inline; tap again → collapses.
  3. Search something with no match (e.g. "zzz") → "No SOPs found" + "Ask Ava instead" button → opens the conversation sheet pre-filled with the query.
  4. **RLS check:** confirm a logged-in driver still sees SOPs (authenticated SELECT) and the table is no longer readable with only the anon key (RLS now ON).
- [ ] **AVA persona is route-scoped — SOP/general questions get a weak answer from the Training "Ask Ava instead" path.** The sheet opens with an EMPTY `seedContext` there, so AVA says it doesn't have route context. If Darren wants SOP-aware AVA (retrieve matching SOP text into the prompt), that's a follow-up — wire SOP lookup into `/api/ava/ask` or a dedicated SOP-answer path.
- [ ] **`/api/ava/ask` trusts the client `seedContext`.** Acceptable (auth-gated employees, driver's own route, worst case a fabricated prompt about a fictional route → harmless). If a stricter posture is ever needed, re-derive stop count / COD / dispatcher notes server-side by `routeId` (but keep weather client-seeded — re-running Tomorrow.io per question is wasteful).
- [ ] **No conversation history cap beyond `MAX_HISTORY=12` turns + no cost ceiling.** Fine for single-day Q&A; revisit if a driver holds a very long session.
- [ ] **SOP search is in-memory over ≤10 rows.** If the SOP Library grows large (50+), switch to a Supabase `textSearch`/`ilike` query (note the PostgREST `.or(ilike)` `*`-wildcard gotcha — see `tasks/lessons.md`).

## May 30, 2026 — AVA Phase 2 — Session 1: Weather Alerts + SOP Foundation (merge `0176699`, LIVE on `main`/production; branch deleted)

Weather-alert pipeline + SOP table/sync foundation. Merged to production on Darren's go. **Not yet smoke-tested on production, and SOP sync is inert until env is set.**

- [ ] **SET `NOTION_API_KEY` on the driver-app Vercel project** (production + preview), server-only (NOT `NEXT_PUBLIC_`), and **share the Notion integration into the "SOP Library" page** (`3590aa6451b8816aa156c77f605facfe`). Until then `POST /api/sop/sync` returns 501 and `sop_entries` stays empty. Optional: `SOP_SYNC_SECRET` for a cron caller (sent as `x-sop-sync-secret`).
- [ ] **Run the sync once `NOTION_API_KEY` is set:** `POST /api/sop/sync` (with a logged-in session or the secret header) → expect `{ synced: 10, errors: [] }` and `sop_entries` populated with SOP-001…010. Spot-check that `content` is non-empty (body extraction is bounded to depth 2 — deeply nested toggles/lists could truncate; widen depth if a SOP body looks short).
- [ ] **Production smoke test** (full matrix in `CLAUDE.md` → "AVA Phase 2 (Driver App) → Session 1"): (1) SOP sync; (2) a stop forecast ≥20 mph at its `calculated_eta` → red `WIND {n}` pill + wind line in the brief — **explicitly test the gust-only case** (e.g. sustained 10 / gust 21 must alert, since `getWindAtTime` now returns `max(sustained,gust)`); (3) depot-ending route → hero "N stops" matches the "1 delivery · 1 pickup" breakdown AND "The day, in N"; (4) "Ask Ava about today" button renders between the stop list and Inspect CTA → coming-soon toast; (5) voice brief reads naturally (ear-check the long wind-advisory variant against the 0.6s pause).
- [ ] **Build the REAL "Ask Ava about today" (deferred Step 6) next AVA session.** Today it's a placeholder (coming-soon toast). Needs: an Anthropic API key on the driver-app env, a server route on `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (key must NOT ship to the browser), and lifting the `AvaChip` drawer into a shared `<AvaConversationSheet open onClose seedContext={…}/>` so both the chip and the home button reach one sheet. Pre-seed context string (per the step plan): stop count + wind-alerted stop names + COD count + driver name.
- [ ] **SOP search UI** — explicitly out of Session 1 scope. The table + sync exist; the driver-facing lookup (and likely the AvaChip mic → STT → SOP lookup) is a later session.
- [ ] **Geocode backfill is lazy, not batched.** Coords populate on first `/api/ava/route-weather` hit per stop (1 req/sec Nominatim). A cold route's first morning load may show no wind pills until the geocode completes; a refresh fills them. If this is too slow in practice, add a one-time batch backfill job. Edge case: a stop whose address Nominatim can't resolve stays null forever (no alert) — acceptable degrade.
- [ ] **`route-weather` has no result cache beyond the weather layer's 15-min snapshot cache.** Every Home mount re-POSTs and re-reads `dispatch_stops`. Fine at current scale; revisit if Home re-renders hammer it.
- [ ] **Edge case (benign, left as-is):** a route with ONLY a `warehouse_return` and zero customer stops makes the hero read "0 stops scheduled" (`customerStopCount` 0) while the day list still shows the depot row. Not real in production. Add a guard only if it ever surfaces.

## May 30, 2026 — Fleet Maintenance driver app — Session 3 (commit `3bda5d7`, on `main`)

UI-only rebuild of the four locked Fleet Maintenance screens (pill tabs + My Log + compliance badges). No migrations, no API routes. Pushed to `main` for Vercel auto-deploy. **Not confirmed on production yet.**

- [x] ~~Smoke test round 1 (2026-05-30)~~ — Steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 passed. Two issues fixed in `0a1cb72`: Bug 1 (My Log infinite spinner — client useEffect race that cancelled its own in-flight fetch; fixed by keying the load on `user.id` only) + Bug 2 (compliance badges added to the Asset Detail header per Darren). **Re-test My Log + Asset Detail badges on production after Vercel deploys `0a1cb72`.**
- [ ] **Smoke-test on production** once Vercel deploys `3bda5d7`/`0a1cb72` (full matrix in `CLAUDE.md` → "Fleet Maintenance Module — Driver App → Session 3 → NEXT smoke test"). Seven loops: (1) three pill tabs + access gate, (2) truck cards w/ mileage + Reg/Insp/Ins badges + WO surfacing, (3) equipment tab + lock chip, (4) My Log = own entries only, (5) Asset Detail tab switching + persistent open-WO block + pinned Log-service CTA, (6) Log Service mileage prefill + entry appears in History AND My Log, (7) Parts tab.
- [ ] **Compliance-badge expiry tiers are driver-app-derived, not dashboard-mirrored.** `complianceStatus()` in `pmStatus.ts` uses a fixed 30-day warning window for registration/inspection/insurance. If the dashboard ever computes a different compliance tier (e.g. per-doc warning columns), mirror it here in the same session — same discipline as the PM-tier logic note at the top of `pmStatus.ts`.
- [ ] **My Log limit is 50 rows.** `fetchMyServiceLog(userId, limit = 50)` caps at the 50 most-recent. No pagination/"load more" — acceptable for the current volume; add paging if a heavy logger tops 50.
- [ ] **Decision deferred:** the spec's Screen 1 truck card lists "year/make/model, current mileage" — we append mileage to the existing subtitle (`"2019 Isuzu NPR · ABC1234 · 12,345 mi"`). If Darren wants mileage on its own line, it's a one-block change in `FleetOverviewScreen` `AssetRow`.

## May 28, 2026 — AVA Phase 1 MERGED to `main` + live in production (merge commit `37f83a9`)

`feature/ava-phase1` merged via `--no-ff` and pushed to `main`; Vercel production deploy READY; branch deleted (local + remote). **All the "NOT merged to main" caveats in the entries below are now historical — the work is live.** The dispatcher/stop-notes smoke matrix (CLAUDE.md → "Dispatcher Notes + Stop Notes surface") now runs against production, not a preview.

- [x] **TTS sentence-pause — confirmed on production (2026-05-28, commit `cc76a02`).** Tuned `SENTENCE_PAUSE` `0.5s → 0.6s` in `src/lib/ava/elevenLabs.ts:26`; pushed to `main`; Darren confirmed the longer pause is audible on the live app. Mechanism unchanged from `9560fb7` (SSML `<break>` on the ElevenLabs request only). Standing fallback if ElevenLabs ever reads the tag *aloud* on turbo_v2 (vs. pausing/ignoring): split the brief into separate audio clips with a real silent gap. Re-tunable any time via the same constant.
- [ ] **Next AVA work goes on a NEW branch** (`feature/ava-phaseN`), not `main` and not the deleted `feature/ava-phase1`.

---

## May 28, 2026 — AVA Phase 1 — Morning-card count fixes (branch `feature/ava-phase1`, commits `71ec8a1`, `dec52c8`)

Two correctness fixes to `AvaMorningCard.tsx` after a live-route test: card visibility decoupled from `checklist_enabled` + stats zero-state; depot stops excluded from all counts; tent count gated on category AND name. Branch still **NOT merged to `main`**.

- [ ] **Smoke-test on the preview deploy:**
  1. **Stop count.** Driver whose route ends at the depot (`warehouse_return`) → Home AVA card / hero stop count excludes the return leg (a 3-leg route reads "2 stops").
  2. **Tent count.** Route with a real tent plus sidewalls/wind walls/door walls (all TapGoods category "TENTS") → checklist/tent count reflects only the actual tent(s), not the accessories. Verify a 20×20 frame tent + walls reads "1 tent", not 5.
  3. **Checklist off, stats on.** Driver with `checklist_enabled=false`, `stats_enabled=true` → AVA card still renders (stats block visible); no checklist offer block.
  4. **Checklist off, stats off, a stop note exists** → card still renders (notes nudge present).
  5. **Stats on, zero completed stops this week** (Monday morning) → stats block shows "No stops completed yet this week." instead of the card vanishing.
- [ ] **Tent/accessory taxonomy is keyword-based, not authoritative.** `countTentItems` name gate (`tent`/`canopy`/`marquee`) is a heuristic over TapGoods names. If a tent product is named without any of those keywords (e.g. a branded "PartyPeak 20×20") it will be missed. The principled fix is TapGoods data hygiene (same root cause as the `resolveCategory` overrides) — revisit if a real tent slips the count. See `tasks/lessons.md`.

---

## May 28, 2026 — AVA Phase 1 — Profile Settings UI (branch `feature/ava-phase1`, commit `35eb566`)

Driver-self-service "AVA Preferences" section on the Profile screen for the three opt-in columns. Branch still **NOT merged to `main`** — pending Darren's go-ahead.

- [ ] **Smoke-test the preview deploy:**
  1. Profile screen → "AVA Preferences" section renders between "My Activity" and "Account": Morning checklist toggle, AVA voice style (Direct | Personality), Weekly stats toggle. Initial states reflect the driver's current DB values.
  2. Flip a toggle → it animates immediately (optimistic). Reload the app → the new value persists (DB write landed). Confirm via dashboard `SELECT checklist_enabled, personality_preference, stats_enabled FROM profiles WHERE id = '<driver>';`.
  3. Flip Weekly stats ON (for a driver with completed stops this week) → return to Home → the AVA morning card now shows the stats line without a logout/login.
  4. Switch AVA voice style to Personality → Home → the morning message uses the personality-variant copy on next mount.
  5. **Failure path:** kill network (DevTools offline) → flip a toggle → it should snap back to the prior state and show the red "Couldn't save preference — try again" toast.
- [ ] **`profiles` has no RLS UPDATE policy (by design).** Driver-editable profile fields must go through `PATCH /api/profile/ava-preferences` (admin client, scoped allow-list). If a future feature needs another driver-editable column, extend that route's allow-list — do NOT add a table-level UPDATE policy (would expose roles / fleet_maintenance_access / work_order_technician to self-mutation).
- [x] ~~**Profile-settings UI for the three opt-in toggles.**~~ Shipped 2026-05-28 (commit `35eb566`).

---

## May 27, 2026 — AVA Phase 1 — Bug Fix Pass (branch `feature/ava-phase1`, commit `4ddcadb`)

Three bug fixes on top of Session 5. Branch still **NOT merged to `main`** — pending Darren's smoke test on the preview deploy, then go-ahead.

- [ ] **Smoke-test the bug fixes on the preview deploy:**
  1. **Bug 1 — Stop Detail note entry.** Open any non-depot stop. Below the manifest block: dashed "Leave a note for the next driver →" link when no notes exist, OR amber "AVA has a note about this stop →" button when ≥1 note exists. Renders on completed stops too (regression from before the fix).
  2. **Bug 1 — Tier 3 hero pill.** Open a stop where a note has been saved → amber "AVA KNOWS THIS STOP" pill below the address in the hero. Open a stop with no notes → no pill.
  3. **Bug 1 — End-to-end note save.** Tap the dashed link → AvaNoteSheet opens → write a note → Save → toast confirms → close the sheet → re-open the stop. Both surfaces (hero pill + post-manifest button) should now show the amber state.
  4. **Bug 2 — Route delete+recreate refresh.** Dashboard: delete the driver's route, create a new route for the same truck same date. Driver app: navigate to Home (or refresh). Home should render the full briefing (hero + day list + AVA card + weather + Gold CTA) for the new, uninspected route. No more blank quiet state.
  5. **Bug 3 — TTS button.** Home → voice mode on (default) → "▶ HEAR YOUR MORNING BRIEF" gold pill button below the message. Tap → ElevenLabs reads the message in natural voice (no robotic WebSpeech fallback on iOS first load). Toggle to TEXT mid-playback → audio stops. Toggle back to VOICE → play button reappears, can replay.
- [ ] **All 9 Phase 1 components + bug fixes landed on `feature/ava-phase1`. Branch is ready to merge to `main` when Darren approves the smoke test.** Don't merge until explicitly told.
- [ ] **Profile-settings UI for the three opt-in toggles** is still pending — columns exist in the DB since Session 1, but the Profile screen has no switches for `checklist_enabled`, `personality_preference`, `stats_enabled`. Pair with whichever upcoming Profile-screen session lets a driver flip these without dashboard support.
- [ ] **Persisting voice/text preference to DB** is deferred. Today it resets to voice default on every card mount. If drivers want a sticky preference, add a `voice_default` column (or extend `personality_preference`) and wire to it from the toggle.
- [ ] **Session 6 — real STT + SOP lookup behind the AvaChip mic button.** Today the button is a stub with a "coming soon" toast. Session 6 wires browser STT (Web Speech API recognition or Whisper) + the SOP retrieval logic, and replaces the toast with the actual conversation UI inside the drawer.

---

## May 27, 2026 — AVA Phase 1 — Session 2 (branch `feature/ava-phase1`)

Morning brief card (Tier 2) + Home post-pre-trip quiet state + weather flag (Part 1). Design doc: `docs/ava/2026-05-27-ava-morning-brief-card.md`. Branch must NOT merge to `main` until all 9 Phase 1 components are in. Vercel auto-deploys as a **preview**.

- [ ] **Smoke-test the preview deploy** once Vercel finishes:
  1. Pre-pre-trip Home: hero (greeting + stop count + truck), day list, "Inspect & Start Route" CTA. AVA card renders only for `stats_enabled=true` drivers (Joey default). Weather card renders only on ≥amber wind/rain/snow at first delivery stop.
  2. Complete pre-trip → return to Home: hero shows greeting + truck only (no sub-copy). Pre-trip receipt, day list, AVA card, weather card, Gold CTA all hidden. FleetAlert + COD still render if applicable.
  3. The "Ask Ava about today" stub button is gone.
  4. Toggle `stats_enabled=true` on a non-Joey profile → AVA card appears on next Home mount.
- [ ] **COD-collected-this-week stat — follow-up.** Stats block currently shows weekly stops only. Adding COD-collected-this-week needs a separate query against `cash_collections` (no FK to dispatch_stops yet — see the Cash Collection v2 follow-up below). When picked up, the field name to use on `PersonalStats` is `weekCodCollectedCents: number | null`. Render line: "$X COD collected this week." appended below the stops line.
- [ ] **Dependency map content authoring** — Darren content task. Until rows exist, `dependencyHits.countHitsForItems` returns 0 and the checklist offer never appears on the AVA card. The helper signature is ready; swap is one file.
- [ ] **Profile-settings UI for the three new toggles** — columns are in the DB (013); the Profile screen still needs the three switches (checklist on/off, personality direct/personality, stats off/on). Pair with this session so Joey can flip his own stats opt-in instead of needing dashboard-side.

---

## May 27, 2026 — AVA Phase 1 — Session 1 (branch `feature/ava-phase1`, commit `c43192c`)

Schema (migrations 013/014/015) + Tier 1 header chip + placeholder drawer pushed to `feature/ava-phase1`. Branch must NOT be merged to `main` until all 9 Phase 1 components are in. Vercel auto-deploys this branch as a **preview**, not production.

- [ ] **Smoke-test the preview deploy** on `feature/ava-phase1` once Vercel finishes:
  1. Open any of Home / Route list / Stop detail / Tools / Training / Profile. Chip renders top-right (32 px blue square with five white waveform bars), bars pulse with staggered animation.
  2. Tap chip → dark bottom-sheet slides up with "AVA coming soon" copy and an X button. Backdrop tap closes; X closes; both leave the screen state unchanged.
  3. From an auth'd dashboard session, `SELECT column_name, column_default FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='profiles' AND column_name IN ('checklist_enabled','personality_preference','stats_enabled');` — confirm all three rows with correct defaults.
  4. `SELECT count(*) FROM public.ava_conversations;` and `SELECT count(*) FROM public.ava_stop_notes;` — both return 0 (tables exist + readable under RLS).
  5. Attempt `INSERT INTO ava_conversations (driver_id, surface, question) VALUES ('<some-other-uuid>', 'driver_home', 'test');` from the driver-app client — should be rejected by RLS (only `driver_id = auth.uid()` allowed).
- [ ] **Session 2 next up — Morning brief card (Tier 2).** Static summary card always renders on Home (driver name, stop count, COD flag, weather flag) — no API call needed, loads instantly. Conditional AVA card below renders only when AVA has something to say. Personality + stats logic per the locked May 24 decisions. Voice/TTS hookup is a separate later session.
- [ ] **Dependency-map content authoring** is a Darren content task, not Claude Code. Driver-app dependency map has 4 driver interviews in (Lucas / Austin / Joey / Dylan); the seed rules in the Notion spec are usable. Dashboard side gets the Melissa voice session before it ships. Once the dependency-map DB rows exist, the checklist component is a session of its own (UI only).
- [ ] **Profile-settings UI for the three new opt-in toggles.** Columns are in the DB (013); the Profile screen still needs the three switches (checklist on/off, personality direct/personality, stats off/on). Pair with the morning brief session so the toggles can be tested end-to-end.
- [ ] **Decision needed before merge to `main`** — order/sequence of remaining Phase 1 sessions (morning brief vs AVA Remembers vs voice). Notion spec doesn't lock the order; pick what unblocks driver feedback fastest.

---

## May 26, 2026 — Work Orders & Field Issues (driver app, Session 2)

Shipped to `main` for Vercel auto-deploy. Driver-app surface on top of dashboard Session 1 (`4e04ac9` — `field_work_orders` Migration 073). Stop-detail link + two Tools Hub cards (ungated "Report an Issue" + technician-gated "Work Orders") + four new routes. One shared `ReportIssueForm` powers both Screen 2A (stop context) and 2B (standalone). Cross-app POSTs go to `${NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_URL}/api/work-orders` with the user's bearer token so the assignee email fires; reads pull straight from supabase under RLS.

- [ ] **Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_URL` on the driver-app Vercel project** (production + preview) **before smoke testing.** Production value: `https://dashboard.partytimerentals.com`. Without it the form throws "NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_URL is not configured" on submit. The example `.env.local.example` already documents it; local dev needs it in `.env.local` too.
- [ ] **Smoke test on production** once env var is live and Vercel redeploys:
  1. Standard driver (no `work_order_technician`): Tools Hub shows "Report an Issue", **not** "Work Orders".
  2. Open a delivery stop → faint-red link below the 3-button quick-action grid. Tap → form opens with locked `#order · customer` bar + item picker. Pick item → Submit → green 6 s `PT-#### · You notified` pill on return. Email arrives.
  3. Same stop → "Item not in this order?" → free-text name + serial → Submit. WO row reflects typed values.
  4. Tools Hub → "Report an Issue" (standalone) → Truck search → pick a truck → Submit. WO row has `asset_id=<truck.id>`, `asset_type='truck'`.
  5. Same flow, no search match → "Enter manually" → Submit. `asset_id=null`, `asset_name` = typed value.
  6. Toggle a profile's `work_order_technician=true` dashboard-side → driver app shows the "Work Orders" Tools Hub card on next mount.
  7. Open `/tools/work-orders` → tabs (Open / In Progress / Done) with counts → tap a card → detail.
  8. Detail: Mark In Progress (only when status='open') → moves between tabs. Mark Complete → Done tab. + Note → bottom-sheet modal → save → notes log shows timestamped entry.
- [ ] **Dashboard route response shape — confirm with dashboard repo.** `createWorkOrder` accepts either `{id, work_order_number, …}` flat OR `{work_order: {…}}` nested. If the route returns something else (e.g. just `{success: true}` with no row data) the success pill will fail with "Dashboard returned an unexpected shape — could not read work order ID." If that happens, pull the actual response shape and tighten `src/lib/workOrders/api.ts`.
- [ ] **PATCH semantics — confirm with dashboard repo.** Add-Note PATCH sends the **full reconstructed `notes` string** (existing + timestamp prefix + new). If the dashboard's PATCH route appends instead of replaces, that will duplicate the old notes. If so, switch to sending only the new note text and let the dashboard append.
- [ ] **listTechnicians query depends on `profiles.work_order_technician` and `roles cs '{super_admin}'` being readable under RLS for any authed user.** Dashboard Session 1 must have set this up, but verify the picker actually populates with non-self technicians in prod. If RLS blocks it, expose a `/api/work-orders/technicians` endpoint on the dashboard and swap the client.

## May 24, 2026 — Auto-logout (driver app, two layers)

Shipped. Drivers share company devices; this closes the gap where the next
driver picked up a device still signed in as the previous driver. Two
complementary layers, driver-app only — no dashboard, no SMS, no migrations.

- **Layer 1 — warehouse_return signOut.** `StopDetailScreen.tsx` welcomeBackAt
  effect: after the 6 s "Welcome back — route complete" banner fully runs,
  clears `ptr_session_date`, calls `supabase.auth.signOut()`, and
  `router.replace('/login')`. The banner finishes naturally — signOut fires
  only on the trailing edge of the existing 6 s timeout.
- **Layer 2 — day-change check.** `LoginScreen.tsx` stamps
  `localStorage.ptr_session_date = YYYY-MM-DD` on a successful sign-in.
  `AuthContext.tsx` checks the value on `INITIAL_SESSION` events (the first
  auth event per page load); if stored ≠ today (or missing), it removes the
  key, signs out, and `window.location.replace('/login')` before any authed
  UI renders. `SIGNED_IN` events are skipped — LoginScreen has just stamped
  the date, so checking would race the new login.

- [ ] **Smoke-test on production** after Vercel deploys this commit:
  1. Trigger the warehouse_return geofence in dev (or run the route to depot)
     → confirm the 6 s welcome-back banner runs in full, then the app
     redirects to `/login` with no session.
  2. DevTools → Application → Local Storage: set `ptr_session_date` to
     yesterday → reload any authed route → expect immediate redirect to
     `/login` before the home screen paints. Console should be clean.
  3. Same-day refresh of an active session → `ptr_session_date` already
     today → no signOut, no redirect, normal render.
  4. Sign in on /login → `ptr_session_date` is set to today; reload → still
     signed in.

## May 23, 2026 — Pre-trip mileage capture (driver app)

Shipped. Required odometer field on Screen 6 (sign_submit), above the certify
checkbox. `POST /api/inspection/submit` validates an integer 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000
(400 on missing/invalid), then writes `trucks.current_mileage` via the admin
client after a successful `vehicle_inspections` insert — unconditional (pre-trip
is ground truth, no forward-only guard) and non-fatal (an UPDATE failure is
logged, never 500s; the federally-required inspection row already exists by
then). Mileage-based PM flagging now activates as soon as a driver submits a
pre-trip — `pmStatus.ts` already knew how to consume the value.

- [ ] **Smoke-test on production** after Vercel deploys this session's commit:
  1. Open a pre-trip on an assigned truck → Screen 6 shows the **Odometer**
     card above the certify checkbox. **Submit Inspection** stays disabled
     until the odometer reads a non-empty digit string AND the certify box is
     checked. The input rejects non-digits, caps at 7 chars.
  2. Submit a valid reading → 200, navigates per outcome. Confirm
     `trucks.current_mileage` is updated on `partytime-east` for that truck.
  3. Hit `POST /api/inspection/submit` with `current_mileage: 3000000` (over
     cap) or missing → 400 with the validator message.
  4. Force a `trucks` UPDATE failure (e.g. flip RLS off-side, or rename the
     column temporarily on staging) → request still returns 200 with the
     inspection id; the failure is logged to Vercel function logs as
     `trucks.current_mileage update failed (non-fatal)`.
  5. Submit two pre-trips in a row with the second reading LOWER than the
     first (unusual but valid for a wrap or admin correction) → the second
     write lands because the write is unconditional.
- [ ] **Optional: confirm dashboard PM tier recompute.** Submit a pre-trip
  whose new `current_mileage` crosses a schedule's `next_due_miles - warning`
  threshold → the dashboard's PM trigger should re-tier on the next read. No
  driver-app code change; just a verification loop.

## May 22, 2026 (evening) — Fleet Maintenance driver-app UI fixes

- [ ] **Equipment management — add/deactivate equipment, split model-level rows
  into per-unit rows (e.g. two forklift models tracked independently), hide
  TapGoods items not relevant to PTR fleet. High priority. Requires dashboard +
  driver app session.** The driver app now shows a disabled "Manage equipment"
  lock affordance on the Equipment section header (tap → toast: "Equipment
  management coming soon — contact your administrator…"). That placeholder sets
  the expectation; the real build is dashboard-owned schema + driver-app UI.
- [ ] **Smoke-test the three UI fixes on production** after Vercel deploys this
  session's commit:
  1. Tap any truck/equipment row on Fleet Overview → Asset Detail loads (name,
     spec, plate/serial, status badge, PM schedule, service history, work
     orders). "Log service" opens the form with **no work order required**.
     "View all work orders" reveals resolved WOs (button shown only when
     resolved WOs exist for the asset).
  2. Fleet Overview layout — Trucks section (open truck WOs above the truck
     list, never collapsed) → Equipment section (open equipment WOs above the
     list; list collapses, default-collapsed at zero equipment WOs,
     default-expanded with ≥1) → "Other work orders" catch-all at the bottom
     (`asset_type` null or asset in neither table; hidden when empty).
  3. Tap the disabled "Manage equipment" lock chip → toast appears, no nav.

## May 22, 2026 — Fleet Maintenance Module (driver app) — commit `46ba851`

- [ ] **Smoke-test on production** after Vercel deploys `46ba851`. Six loops in `CLAUDE.md` → "Fleet Maintenance Module — Driver App" → NEXT block: (1) card gating, (2) overview render + empty states, (3) work order appears in card pill + home alert, (4) log service entry, (5) mark resolved does NOT create a service record, (6) assign + upload invoice.
- [ ] **Darren — populate the `vendors` table.** Empty as of 2026-05-22. The Work Order Detail parts section matches a cross-reference's `brand` text to a `vendors.name` to surface a tap-to-call phone. With zero vendor rows there are no call buttons anywhere — the UI degrades gracefully ("No phone"). Add vendor rows (esp. CarQuest, NAPA) with `phone` set and the call buttons light up automatically, no code change.
- [ ] **Darren — seed CarQuest / NAPA cross-references.** All 26 `part_cross_references` rows are priority-3 (manufacturer-direct: ACDelco, Motorcraft, Mann, Donaldson, Mopar, Fleetguard). Zero priority-1 (CarQuest) or priority-2 (NAPA). The driver-app UI renders whatever exists, sorted by priority, and tags each by tier — it just shows Direct refs until 1/2 are seeded. Verification pass against live CarQuest/NAPA catalogs is a Darren task.
- [ ] **Decide: work-order → parts junction table.** v1 ships with no link between `fleet_work_orders` and `parts`; Screen 3 shows parts that fit the *asset* (via `asset_part_fitments`), labelled "Parts for this asset". A `work_order_parts` junction (curated parts per work order) is a future enhancement — dashboard-side migration if wanted.
- [ ] **chat-Claude — reconcile Notion.** The Fleet Maintenance Build Spec v1.0 access matrix lists "Upload invoice PDF/photo" as ❌ read-only for the driver app. The approved 2026-05-22 mobile design session supersedes that — the driver app DOES upload invoices (Screen 3 action + Screen 4 form). Update the access matrix in Notion.
- [x] ~~**Pre-trip mileage capture (separate driver-app session).**~~ Shipped 2026-05-23 — odometer field on Screen 6 above the certify checkbox; `POST /api/inspection/submit` validates 0–2,000,000 and writes `trucks.current_mileage` via the admin client (unconditional, non-fatal). Mileage-based PM flagging is live.
- [ ] **Work-order-creation notification is a dashboard task.** MBC Part 3 logs "any new `fleet_work_orders` INSERT should email `receives_fleet_notifications` users via Resend." That fires dashboard-side (or a shared cron) — not in the driver app. No driver-app work; noted for cross-repo awareness.
- [ ] **AVA fleet alerts — future session.** Fleet alerts in the AVA morning brief were explicitly deferred. The home `FleetAlertCard` is the interim surface.
- [ ] **Minor — home alert card placement.** `<FleetAlertCard />` sits in `DayRouteSelectorScreen`'s populated-home body (between COD card and day list, per spec). On an empty-route home (e.g. a fleet manager with no route assigned) it does not render — the Tools Hub card is always available as the fallback entry. Revisit only if Darren wants the alert on the empty state too.
- [ ] **Minor — resolved work orders.** A resolved work order's detail screen is reachable only via a stale link (overview + home card list open WOs only). It renders a "Resolved" banner and hides "Mark resolved"; other actions stay enabled. Acceptable.

## May 19, 2026 (evening) — Routes-tab for unassigned drivers + /schedule scroll fix

- [ ] **Smoke-test on production after Vercel deploys** (`ebaebc2` → `ced6aa1` → `d1b1910`):
  1. Driver with no route assigned today → tap Routes tab → lands on `/schedule` (week view), not `/`. BottomNav pinned at bottom. Long week list scrolls inside main area, not at document level.
  2. super_admin with no route assigned → same behavior (regression check vs. morning's `b49e6e1`).
  3. Driver or super_admin with an assigned route → tap Routes → still goes to `/route/[id]` as before.
  4. Land directly on `/route/[bad-id]` (typo'd URL or stale notification) → Today/Week toggle visible at top, "Route not found" banner inside My Route tab body. Tap Week tab → WeekScheduleView renders.
- [ ] **Audit other `className="screen"` pages for inline layout overrides** that conflict with the class. The fix to `/schedule/page.tsx` (commit `d1b1910`) removed inline `minHeight: '100vh'` + `display: flex, flexDirection: column` — the `.screen` class already provides those, and the inline `100vh` actively breaks the iOS Safari toolbar lock (`100vh > 100svh` with the toolbar visible). Grep `className="screen"` across `src/app/` and `src/screens/` and check each for redundant inline `display`/`flexDirection`/`height`/`minHeight`/`overflow`. Likely candidates: any page built before the `.screen` lock was added (pre-2026-05-12). See `tasks/lessons.md` → ".screen utility class is load-bearing."

## May 17, 2026 — Time Window Constraints Phase 4 (driver-app integration)

- [ ] **Smoke-test the three new surfaces on production** after Vercel auto-deploys the three `main` commits (`05b1607`, `ab0bc1e`, `54766d3`). Plan in `CLAUDE.md` → "Time Window Constraints — Phase 4" → NEXT block. Five loops:
  1. Badge renders below the address on StopDetail (on-dark), RouteListScreen rows, and DayRouteSelectorScreen day list (both COD + inline). Constraint-less stops show no badge.
  2. Pickup stop with future `pickup_window_start` → tap Open in Maps → gate modal pops with "Navigate anyway" + "I'll wait". `I'll wait` dismisses cleanly.
  3. Same pickup → tap Open in Maps → tap "Navigate anyway" → maps opens. Re-tap Open in Maps → no modal (override sticky for the session).
  4. Same pickup, fresh session, drive into 150m geofence → `arrived_at` stamps → action card replaced by standby card with live HH:MM:SS countdown. Tap "Navigate anyway" → action card returns.
  5. Suggested-tier stop → badge renders as dashed outline; no gate, no standby.
- [ ] **Walk the visual diff against the Notion confidence-tier table** to confirm the amber palette + dashed-vs-solid treatment matches the dashboard's `StopWindowBlock` chips. Today the driver-app pill is more compact (no event-start anchor line, no ETA cushion math) — that's intentional, but the tier color contract should still match exactly.
- [ ] **Optional: surface the "Event starts X" anchor below the badge on StopDetailScreen** (currently only the badge — the dashboard block also renders the `event_start` / `event_end` anchor as a secondary muted line). Low priority; the badge alone covers the must-deliver-by signal the spec called out as critical.
- [ ] **Optional: persist `early_pickup_override` server-side** via a `stop_workflow_events` row (today it lives only in the `NAVIGATION_STARTED` event detail JSON). Would let the dashboard surface "driver overrode the window" on the stop card without scraping event details. Defer until a dashboard ask materializes.
- [ ] **Long-term: mirroring discipline for `src/lib/stopConstraints.ts`.** Driver-app copy is a strict read-only subset of `partytime-dashboard/src/lib/stopConstraints.ts` (resolver + tier check + clock formatter). If dashboard's resolver changes (new source, reordered priority), mirror here in the same session. Not byte-identical today — driver app has no mutations, no React-Query glue.

## May 16, 2026 — Arcade iPhone controls + canvas layout fix arc

- [x] ~~**iPhone controls + canvas layout — Party Kong.**~~ Confirmed working by Darren after `b7798bf`. Six commits: `78c46c1` (iOS 18 Writing Tools + held-input cancel), `d51e721` (canvas-area shell that pins controls above the fold), `bb4f340` (drop canvas.style.width/height inline lock so CSS drives display), `1b259da` (tighten canvas-to-controls gap), `891adf4` (CSS-crop the empty back-wall + floor-strip band below ground via `VISIBLE_H = 600`), `b7798bf` (switch wrapper to height-driven sizing so aspect-ratio doesn't break on short viewports). Game logic completely untouched. Lessons logged in `tasks/lessons.md` (four new entries).
- [ ] **Smoke-test Route Rush + Tent Tetris on iPhone** to confirm the layout-shell + iOS-guards fixes from `78c46c1`/`d51e721`/`bb4f340` work for them too — Darren confirmed Party Kong but didn't explicitly verify the other two games on iPhone in this arc. Same checklist as the Party Kong loop: controls visible without scrolling, held inputs survive long-press without Writing Tools, truck (RouteRush) and tetromino board (TentTetris) fully visible without clipping at the bottom.
- [ ] **Optional: apply VISIBLE_H-style crop to Route Rush or Tent Tetris** if either game ever shows visible empty space below gameplay. Today Route Rush's truck sits at y=580 of a 720-tall canvas (~140px below sits empty), and Tent Tetris's playfield ends around y=530. Spec for this session was Party Kong-only, but the pattern from `891adf4` + `b7798bf` (`VISIBLE_H` constant + wrapper aspectRatio: `W/VISIBLE_H` + canvas aspectRatio: `W/H` overflowing via `overflow: hidden`, plus the height-driven wrapper sizing) ports directly when needed.

## May 15, 2026 overnight — PartyTime Arcade follow-ups

- [ ] **Smoke-test the arcade on production** after Vercel deploy. Coverage list lives in `CLAUDE.md` → "PartyTime Arcade — Route Rush + Tent Tetris" → NEXT block. Loops: hub load + tile rendering, Route Rush gameplay + leaderboard submit, Tent Tetris gameplay + line clear animation + piece-name labels, cross-device realtime leaderboard fan-out, auth gate.
- [x] ~~**Build Party Kong.**~~ Shipped 2026-05-15 post-overnight session. Single component `PartyKongGame.tsx` + `/training/arcade/party-kong` route + ArcadeHub tile flipped from locked → playable. 4 levels (Warehouse / Loading Dock / Outdoor Tent Setup / Grand Ballroom), DK-style platformer mechanics, NO-OUTLINES shading throughout. Logo loader uses 3-tier fallback chain (spec path → `/ptr-mark.png` → procedural). See CLAUDE.md → "PartyTime Arcade — Party Kong" for architecture details.
- [x] ~~**Smoke-test Party Kong on production**~~ — confirmed working by Darren on iPhone after the 2026-05-16 mobile-fix arc landed (commit `b7798bf`).
- [ ] **Optional: drop the proper hi-res PTR logo at `public/images/PARTYTIME-RENTALS-LOGO.png`.** Today the warehouse sign falls back to `/ptr-mark.png` (which exists). Spec called for a logo at the `/images/` path; the 3-tier loader handles its absence. Drop the file at the spec path and the sign auto-picks it up — no code change needed.
- [ ] **Party Kong v3 — true per-level scenes.** Scoped in `tasks/party-kong-v3-scope.md`. Four-session phased plan: foundation refactor (A) → conveyor stage L2 (B) → elevator stage L3 (C) → rivet/chain-pull stage L4 (D). Each session ships a green-build checkpoint to prod. Total work ≈ 2× current Party Kong codebase. Confirm product direction + pre-flight checklist before starting Session A.
- [ ] **Optional: per-game personal-high-score history.** Today `useGameLeaderboard.personalBestAllTime` reads the user's max score from the all-time top 10. If the user's all-time best falls outside the top 10, the value is `null`. Cheap fix: a dedicated `.from('game_scores').eq('player_id', uid).eq('game_type', gt).order('score desc').limit(1)` call (mirrors the ArcadeHub `bests` loader). Now that all three games are live this is more meaningful to add.
- [ ] **Optional: arcade-side rate limit.** RLS lets any authenticated user spam INSERTs at `auth.uid()`. Acceptable today (trusted driver fleet). If/when public access opens up, throttle via a Postgres function + grant.

## May 14, 2026 night — Tools / Training hub restructure follow-ups (commits `f64d5bb` → `288d120`)

- [ ] **Smoke-test the v2 hubs on production** (latest is `288d120`). Coverage list in `CLAUDE.md` → "Tools Hub + Training Hub — category-card restructure" → NEXT block. `/tools`: dark surface, uppercase title, 6-tile grid, Weather + Equipment guides land on existing routes, Generators full-width, divider, Party layouts anchor card. `/training`: 4-tile grid + orientation + Arcade (no badge). Toast = small dark pill, 2s dismiss, no gold accent. Spot-check that Weather + Reference Library still load identically to pre-restructure.
- [x] ~~**`/games` route does not exist.**~~ Resolved 2026-05-15. The Arcade tile now points at `/training/arcade` (PartyTime Arcade hub) — Route Rush + Tent Tetris are live; Party Kong is the locked third tile.
- [x] ~~**Tenting subcategory screen.**~~ Shipped 2026-05-19. New `/tools/tenting` route + `TentingHubScreen.tsx` — two live tiles: Tent calculator (→ `/tools/tent-squaring`) + Drawings & certs (→ `/reference/tents`). Tenting card in ToolsScreen now points to `/tools/tenting`.
- [ ] **Duplicated layout components between ToolsScreen and TrainingScreen.** `C` token object, `BadgePill`, `IconWrap`, `CategoryCardGrid`, `CategoryCardWide`, and several Tabler-style icons (TentIcon, ShieldCheckIcon) are redeclared in both files. The toast block is also inline-duplicated. Acceptable today (two screens, fully styled differently from the rest of the app); extract to `src/components/hub/*` when a third hub-style surface appears or when an icon needs to change in lockstep across both.
- [x] ~~**Tools hub footer pointer line.**~~ Resolved in v2 (`288d120`) — Weather and Equipment Guides are now first-class tiles in the grid; footer text removed.

## May 14, 2026 — Phase 2.5C session follow-ups (GPS Auto-Arrival)

- [ ] **Smoke-test arrival on production** — driver `73b7509`, dashboard `03dd102` both deployed. Test plan in `CLAUDE.md` → "Phase 2.5C — GPS Auto-Arrival" → NEXT block. Loops: permission prompt on first watch, mid-route entry into the 150m bubble, dashboard teal pin within ~1s, badge coexistence with the green completion check, persistence across refetch.
- [ ] **Phase 2 — Real-time push to dispatch on arrival.** Today Melissa sees the teal pin update visually via realtime; no audible signal. Pair with the existing "real-time COD-uncollected push to dispatch" Phase 2 item — same channel.
- [ ] **Phase 2 — Background geofencing (native shell).** Current implementation is foreground-only (`navigator.geolocation.watchPosition` requires the document visible on mobile browsers). For autonomous arrival when the driver locks the phone or backgrounds the PWA, need Capacitor or a native shell with the Android Geofence API. Out of scope for v1 PWA.
- [ ] **Phase 2 — Driver-side "location off" warning.** `useArrivalGeofence` already surfaces `denied` / `unavailable` / `error` states; the UI currently ignores them. A small inline hint on StopDetailScreen ("Location off — arrival won't auto-detect") would help when permissions are denied. Low priority because Mark Stop Complete still works.
- [ ] **Phase 2 — Arrival → completion delta analytics surface.** The data now flows into `arrived_at` and `completed_at`. A simple report (avg on-site time, outliers) would be useful for ops. Dashboard-side; out of scope this session.

## May 14, 2026 — bug-fix session follow-ups

- [ ] **Smoke-test on production** after the May-14 Vercel deploys clear. Coverage list lives in `CLAUDE.md` → "Driver scope + completion persistence" → NEXT. Three loops: driver-scope (Home + Routes tab), completion persistence (mark-complete → return-nav), Cash Collection v2 (Collected / Could Not Collect paths now that migration 051 is live).
- [ ] **Regen dashboard repo Supabase types** so the `as any` casts in `partytime-dashboard/src/lib/boardClient.ts` (`fetchUncollectedCodRows`) come out. Driver-app types are already current (commit `c308c81`). One-line: `cd ~/Projects/partytime-dashboard && supabase gen types typescript --linked > src/types/supabase.ts` — but strip the stderr lines that the CLI bleeds into the redirected file ("Initialising login role…" header, "A new version…" footer); see lessons.md.
- [ ] **Delete unused `AppStateContext.clearCache`.** Orphaned since the cold-load auto-redirect was removed (no caller). Comment block references stale "assigned-route check" infra. One-line removal; bundle with the next AppStateContext touch.

## Cash Collection v2 — surviving follow-ups (from 2026-05-13)

- [x] ~~**BLOCKING: apply migration 051 to partytime-east.**~~ APPLIED 2026-05-14 via `supabase db query --linked --file`. Tracking repaired. Driver-app types regen'd.
- [ ] **Drop the orphan `dispatch_stops.cod_acknowledged_at` and `dispatch_stops.cod_acknowledged_by` columns.** Audit done 2026-05-13 — zero readers, zero writers. Cash Collection v2 uses payment_state-based auto-resolution instead. Wait until schema confidence is high; bundle with the next housekeeping migration.
- [ ] **Phase 2 — Real-time COD-uncollected push to dispatch.** Today Melissa learns about the flag via the board's visible realtime update (~1s after the driver submits). A push/SMS notification would help if she's heads-down on something else when it lands. Same channel as the planned pre-trip OOS auto-notify (currently Phase 2 stub copy on Screen 7).
- [ ] **Add an FK from `cash_collections.stop_id` to `dispatch_stops.id`** so PostgREST can embed cash_collections in a stops fetch (one query instead of two). Low priority — current pattern (separate query, deduped by tanstack-query) works fine for the dashboard's volume. Bundle with the schema cleanup migration above.

## Cross-repo: Mirrored helpers (added 2026-05-13)

Three helpers are now byte-for-byte mirrored between `partytime-driver-app/src/lib/` and `partytime-dashboard/src/lib/`:
- `equipmentSummary.ts` — two-tier `{ tier1, tier2 }` shape consumed by all condensed surfaces
- `inflatable.ts` — `isInflatableCategory()` + `hasInflatableItem()` keyword detection
- `itemCategories.ts` — `resolveCategory()` + `CATEGORY_MAP` (lowercased keys, canonical-cased values)

There is **no shared package and no build-time validation that the copies match.** Drift is silent until a user-visible bug surfaces.

- [ ] **Long-term:** extract these three files into a shared workspace package (e.g. `@partytime/items`) so a single change updates both consumers. Requires monorepo or git-submodule setup; currently both repos are independent.
- [ ] **Short-term discipline:** any change to one of these files MUST be applied to the other in the same session, with matching commit messages. Document in CLAUDE.md (already done in the equipment-summary architecture section).
- [ ] **`resolveCategory` name overrides are workarounds.** The CHAIR / STAGE / SKIRT / RAMP / DECK / TENT / WALL / DANCE FLOOR name detection rescues TapGoods miscategorizations. The principled long-term fix is to recategorize source items in TapGoods so the API category matches. Audit + clean up the override list when TapGoods data hygiene reaches a steady state.

## Cross-repo: Dashboard data hygiene to simplify driver-app filter (discovered 2026-05-08)

The driver app's `/api/routes` endpoint currently filters stops by `calculated_eta IS NOT NULL` to drop ghost assignments (stops dragged onto a route weeks ago and never optimized or unassigned). This is a workaround. The principled fix lives in the **dashboard repo**:

- [ ] When a dispatcher assigns a stop to a route in the dashboard (drag-drop, or any other path that sets `dispatch_stops.route_id`), also set `dispatch_stops.scheduled_date = routes.route_date` for that stop. Today, only `route_id` and `route_position` are updated, so pickup stubs retain their auto-anchored Monday `scheduled_date` even after assignment.
- [ ] Backfill pass: for every existing `dispatch_stops` row where `route_id IS NOT NULL`, update `scheduled_date` to match the route's `route_date`. One-shot SQL or admin endpoint.
- [ ] After the dashboard ships the above + backfill runs cleanly, revert this repo's `/api/routes/route.ts` filter from `.not('calculated_eta', 'is', null)` back to `.eq('scheduled_date', date)`. Cleaner, doesn't depend on a derived signal.

## Tools Hub — Content Build (Phase 2 — content authoring + UI)

Empty shells exist on `/tools` for the tile grid. Content + per-tool UI is the work:
- [x] Tenting calculator — tent squaring (shipped 2026-05-14 late evening — `/tools/tent-squaring`, replaces the Tenting tile's coming-soon stub. When additional tenting calcs land (anchoring, etc.), convert the route into a tenting sub-hub.)
- [ ] Occupant load calculator — IFC Chapter 31 load factors by layout type
- [ ] Exit count and spacing calculator — 100 ft max rule, 0.2 in/person egress width
- [ ] Generator placement rule flag — 20 ft minimum
- [ ] Fire Code Pre-Job Checklist — dynamic by job config; NFPA 701 fabric cert photo capture; permit trigger by tent size; timestamped completion record
- [ ] Site map generator (Phase 2 — canvas tech stack prototype required first)
- [ ] Multi-tent site map (Phase 2)
- [ ] Jurisdiction-aware fire code (Phase 3 — UpCodes API)
- [ ] Shareable crew report (Phase 3)
- [ ] Tenting reference library — manufacturer-specific diagrams
- [ ] Dance floor / stage / heat-and-air / power / propane calculators
- [ ] Equipment Knowledge Base
- [ ] Wind-aware anchoring guidance (Phase 2C — needs `HAS_ANCHORING_GUIDANCE` flag flip)

## Training Module — Content Build (Phase 2)
- [ ] SOP library — schema and tagging convention in Supabase defined
- [ ] SOP content authored and loaded
- [ ] Quick-hit video integration
- [ ] Short role-based checklists
- [ ] Safety reminders module
- [ ] Equipment basics training content

## Driver Profile / Compliance — Feature Build (Phase 2, Ready)
- [ ] Document upload — DOT medical card, West Point ID, site-specific credentials
- [ ] Expiration date tracking per document type
- [ ] 30-day reminder trigger before expiration
- [ ] Persistent alerts until document is updated
- [ ] Future: supervisor visibility to compliance status per driver

## Phase 2C — Wind-aware anchoring guidance (deferred)
- [ ] Author content layer
- [ ] Flip `HAS_ANCHORING_GUIDANCE = true` in `src/lib/weather/thresholds.ts`
- [ ] Wire stake/ballast guidance into wind cards on Tools weather screen + Stop Detail weather module

## Phase 2B — Tent-size threshold differentiation (deferred)
- [ ] Dashboard pipeline: TapGoods tent size flows through `dispatch_stops` (separate dashboard session)
- [ ] Flip `HAS_TENT_SIZE_DATA = true` in `src/lib/weather/thresholds.ts`
- [ ] Rain thresholds will then differentiate by tent size; the existing 30x40+ conservative defaults stay until that lands

## Phase 2.5 — Driver App Source of Truth Migration (Notion-tracked)
- [x] Phase A: Stop data from Supabase (replace TapGoods direct calls). 2.5a cleanup 2026-05-10 commit `15d3476` deleted the orphaned `/api/tapgoods/routes` handler + `tapgoodsClient.ts` + `tapgoodsQueries.ts` + `tapgoodsTransform.ts`. Driver app now exclusively reads routes/stops from Supabase via `/api/routes`. Surviving `tapgoods_*` column references in `src/types/supabase.ts`, `src/app/api/routes/route.ts`, `src/lib/supabaseTransform.ts`, and `src/config/externalApps.ts` are legitimate (column names + View Order URL template) and stay.
- [ ] Phase B: Live ETA + status sync (mostly done — Migration 033 + cascade live)
- [x] Phase C: Driver assignment from dashboard — auto-load shipped 2026-05-10 evening. New endpoint `/api/routes/assigned` + hook `useAssignedRoute` + DayRouteSelectorScreen wiring. Once-per-session redirect from `/` → `/route/<id>` on cold sign-in when the driver has a `route_assignments` row for today; manual day overview preserved as fallback for unassigned drivers, fetch failures, and post-redirect BottomNav returns to Home.

## Pre-trip inspection — edge cases to revisit (discovered 2026-05-09)

- [ ] **Trailer rows on `dvir_requirement = 'never'` trucks.** Screen 5 currently
      treats `towingTrailer !== false` as "show trailer rows" — for `'always'`
      and `'never'` trucks (no Screen 4 fired), `towingTrailer` stays `null`,
      so the full 12-row checklist renders. Conservative default: include
      trailer rows when we don't know. By definition `'never'` trucks don't tow,
      so hiding the trailer rows for that branch is safe. Low priority — the
      conservative default (show all 12) is compliant and harmless. Likely
      target: when `dvir_requirement === 'never'`, omit `TRAILER_CATEGORIES`
      from the visible list in `case 'checklist'`.
      Location: `src/screens/InspectionScreen.tsx`, `case 'checklist'`.

- [ ] **OOS auto-notify is user-facing copy only.** Screen 7's quiet green
      "Dispatcher has been notified · HH:MM" line on the OOS state promises a
      notification that doesn't actually fire. Today the dispatcher sees the
      OOS via the fleet board's red banner. Wire to real SMS/email in Phase 2
      per the Notion DVIR spec ("Phase 2 — SMS/email alert to designated
      maintenance contact when OOS defect raised").
      Location: `src/screens/InspectionScreen.tsx`, `case 'complete'` (OOS branch).

- [ ] **Non-transactional inspection submit.** `POST /api/inspection/submit`
      inserts `vehicle_inspections` first, then `vehicle_defects` rows. If the
      defects insert fails after the inspection succeeded, the driver has an
      inspection row with no defect rows — Home gate opens (status fetch sees
      a current inspection), but maintenance loses visibility into the flagged
      defects. Fail-open in the wrong direction. Fix with a Postgres RPC that
      wraps both inserts in a transaction. Until then, the existing TODO
      comment in the route handler documents the gap.

## Post-trip defect report — feature spec (discovered 2026-05-09, shipped 2026-05-10 partial)

- [x] **Build the post-trip defect report flow.** Built 2026-05-10. Surface lives on Home, appears after route complete, optional (no gate). Single screen with category picker, severity toggle, description, submit. Implementation diverged from the May 9 sketch: a single new column `vehicle_defects.reported_context` (instead of `inspection_type` + parallel `vehicle_inspections` row) was added in migration 009. Post-trip rows have `inspection_id = NULL` (the NOT NULL constraint was dropped in the same migration). Files: `src/components/PostTripDefectCard.tsx`, `src/app/api/defects/post-trip/route.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260510_009_post_trip_reported_context.sql`. Wired into `src/screens/DayRouteSelectorScreen.tsx`. Category list duplicated locally in the new component pending pre-trip stabilization (TODO comment present in both surfaces).
- [ ] **Apply migration 009 to partytime-east.** Could not be pushed by the driver-app CLI due to the two-repo migration coordination problem (see lessons.md). SQL must be run by Darren via Supabase Studio SQL Editor. Verification SQL + step-by-step instructions in `tasks/open-questions.md`.
- [ ] **Extract 12-category list to `src/lib/defect-categories.ts`** when pre-trip stabilizes. Currently duplicated in `InspectionScreen.tsx`, `PostTripDefectCard.tsx`, `/api/inspection/submit/route.ts`, and `/api/defects/post-trip/route.ts` with `// TODO` markers in the new copies.
- [ ] **Optional: add `route_id` to `vehicle_defects`** so a post-trip defect carries an explicit route link rather than relying on `reported_at::date` for the per-route audit trail. Low priority. Open question logged for Darren.
- [ ] **Optional: real-time post-trip notification.** Today the post-trip submission writes to `vehicle_defects`; surfacing it to maintenance/dispatch is whatever the dashboard's existing defect view does. If push/SMS is desired (parallel to the planned pre-trip OOS auto-notify), that's a separate Phase 2 item.

- Easy RFID Pro launch on Android (out of v1.1 scope)
- CoPilot destination import — final validation on real device
